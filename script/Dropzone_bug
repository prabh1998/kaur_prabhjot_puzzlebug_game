Issue: 
User was able to drop all images in one drop zone and these images overlap each other and became undragable.

Solution:
To solve this problem firstly we should check this zone have a child or not before adding another.

Instructions:
1) Go the the "zone.addEventListener("drop", function(e){})" function you will get access to target the drop zone.
2) To check zone already have child or not use the "zone.Children.length"
3) If the condition is true use "e.target.appendChild(document.querySelector('#${draggedElement}'));"
4) If step 3 is isn't working use console.log("Zone already has an element in it.")
